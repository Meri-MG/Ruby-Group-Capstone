# Catalog of my things
In this group project, will be created a console app that will help the user to keep a record of different types of things they won: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data will be stored in JSON files but also will be prepared in a database with tables structure analogical to the program's class structure.
